Current version of TBEDP only supports parsing of a slot item as an atomic element. Newer
versions should be able to process separately slot name, slot equal sign, and
slot value. Also it should be possible to to have rules triggered only on some
parts of sentence and modifying only specific slot items in proximity. As a
result I could generalize across different slot items e.g. != operator. TAG: http://code.google.com/p/tbed-parser/source/browse/#svn/tags/atomic-slot-item-parser
