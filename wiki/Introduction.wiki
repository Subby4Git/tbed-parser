The TBED (Transformation-Based Error-Driven Parser) parser aka TBL parser produces semantic annotation in form of frames and slots.  

= Dialogue Act Semantic Scheme =

The CUED dialogue act scheme is frame and slot based semantics. Each dialogue act is composed of a dialogue act type and several slots. The dialogue acts are allowed to be without slots. Examples of dialogue acts are provided below:

{{{
i want to drink wine <=> inform(drinks=wine)
near the castle <=> inform(near=Castle)
serves beer <=> inform(drinks=beer)
does not serve wine <=> inform(drinks!=wine)
serves no wine <=> inform(drinks!=wine)
serves no beer <=> inform(drinks!=beer)
restaurant which serves wine <=> inform(type=restaurant,drinks=wine)
does serve wine serves not beer <=> inform(drinks=wine,drinks!=beer)
it is not near castle and serve wine <=> inform(near!=Castle,drinks=wine)
restaurant near the castle <=> inform(near=Castle,type=restaurant)
somewhere not near the castle <=> inform(near!=Castle)

do they serve draft beer <=> confirm(drinks=beer)
is it somewhere near castle <=> confirm(near=Castle)
is it near castle <=> confirm(near=Castle)
is it near fountain <=> confirm(near="Fountain Inn")

can i get phone number please <=> request(phone)
can I get address and phone of the fountain inn <=> request(address,phone,name="Fountain Inn")
}}}

The TBL parser tries to produce this type of semantics of any input word sequence. Of course, only for in domain utterances the output is acceptable.
